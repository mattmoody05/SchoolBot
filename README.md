# SchoolBot

## A discord bot developed by [Exainz](https://github.com/Exainz) and [Matt](https://github.com/mattmoody05), completely open source, for a 'Timathon' Project

### Please see [here](setup.md) for detailed setup instructions

### Project background
To begin this project, we were set a brief to create a project that would be useful for students. Given the fact that home learning is becoming more common in the COVID-19 period, this means more students are able to communicate with other students using services like Discord. This meant that having features that students may find useful, such as research platforms, timetable & task tracking, timers and access to music would be extremely useful if they are in one place. This is what our bot set out to achieve, and we believe that it is successful at its aim.
